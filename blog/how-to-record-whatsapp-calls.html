            <p class="article-disclosure">Disclosure: Mono is our product. We've included it in this guide and tried to be fair, but you should know we have a stake in it.</p>
        </header>

        <div class="article-body">

            <p>WhatsApp Desktop doesn't have a built-in call recording feature. Whether you need to save an important business conversation, keep a record of a family call, or document a discussion, you'll need a third-party screen recorder or audio capture tool to record WhatsApp calls on your computer.</p>

            <p>This guide covers how to record WhatsApp voice calls and video calls reliably in 2026, with methods for both audio-only recording and full video recording.</p>

            <div class="tldr">
                <p class="tldr-label">TL;DR</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best overall:</strong> Mono — invisible recording, AI transcription, $50 once</li>
                    <li><strong>Best free:</strong> OBS Studio — requires setup, no transcription</li>
                    <li><strong>Built-in:</strong> None — WhatsApp has no native recording</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Why Record WhatsApp Calls?</h2>

            <p>WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging apps worldwide, handling billions of voice calls and video calls daily. Recording these conversations serves many legitimate purposes:</p>

            <p><strong>Business documentation:</strong> Customer support teams, sales professionals, and consultants often need records of client conversations. Recording WhatsApp business calls creates accountability and helps resolve disputes.</p>

            <p><strong>Personal memories:</strong> Conversations with elderly relatives, long-distance friends, or family abroad are moments worth preserving. Audio calls can capture stories and voices that matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Interviews and research:</strong> Journalists, podcasters, and researchers frequently conduct interviews over WhatsApp. Recording ensures accurate quotes and lets you focus on the conversation instead of taking notes.</p>

            <h2>Method 1: Mono (Recommended)</h2>

            <p>Mono is a desktop application designed for recording and transcribing conversations. It captures internal audio directly from your system's sound output, recording exactly what you hear through your speakers or headphones — including both sides of your WhatsApp call.</p>

            <p>Because Mono captures system audio rather than joining the call, there's no notification to the other person. After you stop recording, Mono transcribes the conversation locally using AI. The transcription runs entirely on your computer, so your audio isn't uploaded anywhere.</p>

            <h3>How to record WhatsApp calls with Mono</h3>

            <ol class="steps-list">
                <li>Download Mono from <a href="https://mono-ai.uk">mono-ai.uk</a> and install it</li>
                <li>Ensure WhatsApp Desktop is connected to your phone</li>
                <li>Open Mono and click the Record button to begin recording</li>
                <li>Start your WhatsApp call (voice or video)</li>
                <li>Have your conversation normally</li>
                <li>When the call ends, click Stop in Mono</li>
                <li>Wait for the automatic transcription to complete</li>
                <li>Review your transcript with speaker labels and timestamps</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Mono's transcription includes speaker identification — it detects different voices and labels them throughout the transcript. You can search across all your recordings by keyword, making it easy to find specific conversations or topics later.</p>

            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Works with voice and video calls, invisible to other participants, automatic transcription with speaker identification, searchable recordings, good audio quality, one-time $50 payment with no subscription.</p>

            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Paid software (one free recording available to try before purchasing).</p>

            <h2>Method 2: OBS Studio (Free)</h2>

            <p>OBS Studio is free, open-source screen recording software primarily used by streamers and content creators. It can capture system audio and optionally your screen, making it suitable for recording WhatsApp calls. OBS requires initial configuration but works reliably once set up.</p>

            <p>Like Mono, OBS captures audio from your system's output, so the other person won't know you're recording. However, OBS doesn't include transcription — you get a raw audio file that you'll need to process yourself if you want text.</p>

            <h3>How to record WhatsApp calls with OBS</h3>

            <ol class="steps-list">
                <li>Download OBS Studio from obsproject.com and install it</li>
                <li>Open OBS and go to Settings → Audio</li>
                <li>Set "Desktop Audio" to your playback device (speakers or headphones)</li>
                <li>In the main window, click + under Sources</li>
                <li>Add an "Audio Output Capture" source to capture internal audio</li>
                <li>Click "Start Recording" before making your WhatsApp call</li>
                <li>Make your call in WhatsApp Desktop</li>
                <li>Click "Stop Recording" when the call ends</li>
                <li>Find your recording in the output folder (usually Videos)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Completely free and open source, invisible to other participants, can record video calls with screen recording, highly configurable settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires initial setup, you must manually begin recording and stop recording for each call, no transcription — produces raw audio files only.</p>

            <h2>Recording WhatsApp Video Calls</h2>

            <p>Both methods work for WhatsApp video calls, but they capture different things:</p>

            <p><strong>Audio-only (Mono):</strong> Captures the conversation audio with automatic transcription. This is often sufficient since most people record calls to preserve what was said, not how people looked. Files are small and easy to manage.</p>

            <p><strong>Full video recording (OBS):</strong> Captures your screen showing the WhatsApp video call window. Add a "Display Capture" or "Window Capture" source to record video. Be aware that video quality depends on your connection, and video files are much larger than audio files.</p>

            <p>For most use cases, audio-only recording with transcription is more practical than video recording. You get searchable text and smaller files.</p>

            <h2>Why WhatsApp Doesn't Have Built-in Recording</h2>

            <p>WhatsApp emphasizes privacy as a core feature, with end-to-end encryption on all calls and messages. Adding built-in call recording would create privacy concerns — recordings could be made without the other party's knowledge or consent.</p>

            <p>By not including recording, WhatsApp maintains its privacy-focused positioning. This means users who need recordings for legitimate purposes must use external tools. The advantage is that recordings stay entirely on your computer, under your control, rather than being uploaded to WhatsApp's servers.</p>

            <h2>Legal Considerations</h2>

            <p>Recording laws vary by jurisdiction. Before recording WhatsApp calls, understand the rules where you are:</p>

            <p><strong>One-party consent:</strong> Many places allow recording calls you're participating in without telling the other person.</p>

            <p><strong>All-party consent:</strong> Some jurisdictions require everyone on the call to agree to recording. This includes California, Germany, and other regions.</p>

            <p>For business calls, consider informing the other party that you're recording. This protects you legally and builds trust with clients and partners.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Better WhatsApp Call Recordings</h2>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <p><strong>Use headphones</strong> to prevent echo — your microphone won't pick up the other person's voice from your speakers. <strong>Ensure WhatsApp Desktop is connected</strong> to your phone before starting. <strong>Test with a short call</strong> before important conversations.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Check your connection:</strong> WhatsApp call quality depends on internet connection. Use a wired connection for important calls when possible.</p>

            <p><strong>Close other apps:</strong> Applications that produce notification sounds can be captured in your recording. Mute or close them before starting.</p>

            <p><strong>Verify audio levels:</strong> Make a short test recording to confirm you can hear both yourself and the other person clearly in the playback.</p>

            <h2>Which Method Should You Use?</h2>

            <p><strong>If you need transcription:</strong> Mono automatically converts your WhatsApp calls to searchable text with speaker labels. This saves hours compared to manually transcribing recordings.</p>

            <p><strong>If you want free:</strong> OBS Studio works reliably but requires setup and produces raw audio files without transcription.</p>

            <p><strong>For business use:</strong> Mono's organized library and search features make it easier to find specific conversations later. The one-time payment works well for ongoing use.</p>

            <p><strong>For video recording:</strong> OBS Studio with screen recording captures both video and audio. Mono focuses on audio with automatic transcription.</p>
